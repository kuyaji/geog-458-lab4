[Map of Chinatown and Light Rails](https://kuyaji.github.io/geog-458-lab4/)


In this project, I examined Seattle, specifically Chinatown and mapped out the Light Rail stations around the area.

There are three layers available.

### Basemap

This layer shows the general area, with city and town names.
